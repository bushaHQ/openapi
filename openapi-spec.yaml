    ## Introduction
    The **Busha API** is designed to provide businesses with tools for borderless financial transactions and operations, enabling modern, global money management. It serves as the backbone for facilitating:
    - Creation and management of multi-currency balances
    - Retrieval of real-time cryptocurrency rates
    - Substantial data insights for business owners

    Whether you’re a product-driven fintech or a developer building integrations, this API significantly accelerates implementation while reducing financial complexities.
    For detailed guides on API integration, visit our [official documentation]().


    ## Authentication
    All API requests require a **Bearer Token** for authentication, passed in the `Authorization` header.
    Your authorization value is a base64 encoded value of your api key and your secret key.
    You can obtain API tokens via your Busha user or business account. Authentication is mandatory to ensure secure and authorized interactions with the API.
    The API keys from the dashboard provides a base64 encoding of the your authorization tokens.

    Your generated Key should look like this:
    `VURtNXhWcHueantkpaiewjo0S044MWsadfojienuoxRTiWDJaeWJaTGxxanZ3Ym10OU1RZnVWajVW=`

    Example Header:
    ``` curl
    Authorization: Bearer VURtNXhWcHueantkpaiewjo0S044MWsadfojienuoxRTiWDJaeWJaTGxxanZ3Ym10OU1RZnVWajVW=
    ```

    ## Error Handling
    #Standardized error responses ensure predictable interactions. Errors are detailed for easy debugging and understanding:
    | **Error Code** | **HTTP Status Code** | **Description** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | `bad_request` | 400 | Invalid input or malformed request |
    | `unauthorized` | 401 | Invalid or missing authentication |
    | `not_found` | 404 | Resource not found |
    | `service_unavailable` | 503 | Server error |

    Basic Error Example:
    ``` json
    {
      "error": {
        "name": "bad_request",
        "message": "Invalid input data"
      }
    }
    ```

    Schema Error Body Example:
    ``` json
    {
      "error": {
        "name": "bad_request",
        "message": "Invalid input data"
      },
      "schema": {
        "reason": "The request body is defined as an object. However, it does not meet the schema requirements of the specification",
        "fix": "Ensure that the object being submitted, matches the schema correctly"
      }
    }
    ```

    Field Error Body Example:
    ``` json
    {
      "error": {
        "name": "bad_request",
        "message": "Invalid input data"
      },
      "fields": {
        "field1": [
          {
            "reason": "The request body is defined as an object. However, it does not meet the schema requirements of the specification",
          },
        ],
        "field2": [
          {
            "reason": "The request body is defined as an object. However, it does not meet the schema requirements of the specification",
          }
        ],
      }
    }
    ```

    ## Pagination
    Pagination uses cursors provided as:
    The API supports **cursor-based pagination** for endpoints with large datasets. Pagination uses a `next_cursor` and `previous_cursor` returned in the response.
    Example Response Format:
    ``` json
    {
      "current_entries_size": 10,
      "next_cursor": "base64_cursor_value",
      "previous_cursor": "base64_previous_cursor_value"
    }
    ```

    ## Rate Limiting
    Rate limits determine how many API calls can be made in a rolling minute. This ensures fair and optimized use of system resources.

    The rate limits allowed by each resource will be provided with the header:
    ```curl
    x-rate-limit 100
    ```
    If this header does not exist, then the rate limit is set at a default 100 req/min

    Requests exceeding the allocated quota will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

    ##  Common Parameters
    Common parameters enhance consistency across endpoints:
      | **Parameter Name** | **Location** | **Description** | **Example** |
      | --- | --- | --- | --- |
      | `X-BU-PROFILE-ID` | Header | User profile identifier | `BUS_qwejinoiuiqw93ejjw` |
      | `id` | Path | Unique NanoID identifier | `dpt_jweqafajsndiun34fd` |
      | `cursor` | Query | Pagination cursor | `base64_cursor_string` |

    #### Paginated Response Example
      ``` json
      {
        "status": "success",
        "message": "Data retrieved",
        "pagination": {
          "next_cursor": "value_for_next_page",
          "current_entries_size": 20
        },
        "data": [...]
      }
